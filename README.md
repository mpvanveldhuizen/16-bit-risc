### About
Designed and created a 16-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) style microprocessor. The project included making several components using Altera Quartus II written in VHDL. 

Some of the components that were developed for a microprocessor include:
* Arithmetic Logic Unit
* Registers
* Data Memory
* Instruction Memory
* and more. 

The microprocessor was to run a reduced set of 16-bit MIPS assembly instructions. 

This was done along side a class at the University of Alaska Fairbanks in the undergraduate program
